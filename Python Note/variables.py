# Hey lazy person, Welcome back & don't laugh at my english!
# In python, there's have various types of variables. Let's see what kind of variable python have.

# -> String
# It's very simple dude! Just write your values in the "" or ''. Let's take a look

str_var = "Hey man! It's string, do you know me"
print(str_var) # That's good! It's working.

# -> Numeric data: int, float, complex

# -> int
# -> It's simple as string is. We don't have to do anything, just write a number like 1 or 100 or maybe 1000 or the number you want.
int_var = 2005
print(int_var) # Good it's working. What, want to do some addition? Okay Let's do it.

int_var2 = 10 # Let's add 2005 + 10
print(int_var + int_var2) # It's pretty easy right!

# -> float
# float is also number, just we have to add dot (.) like 10.5
float_var = 10.5
print(float_var) # Let's check it's data type. What, don't know how to check data type? It's easy man, just type "type(var_name)" this function.
print(type(float_var)) # Awesome!

# -> complex
# I don't know how complex number works. For declearing complex number just type any complex number like 3j.

complex_var = 3j
print(complex_var, type(complex_var)) # Yeah that's complex number!

# -> list
# We declear list in squir brackets. In this brackets we can write multiple values & this datatypes are can be differen. We can separate the values by comma (,) also we can change list value. Let's have a look!

list_var = ["Drawing", "Sketching", "Painting"]
print(list_var, type(list_var)) # Amazing!

# -> touple
# Touple is same as list. Just we declear touple by paranthesis brackets & also we can't change touple values.

touple_var = ("Python", "JavaScript", "C")
print(touple_var, type(touple_var)) # Beautiful

# -> dictionary
#  dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. we can declear dictionary by curly brackets.

dictionary_var = {"name": "yaxisus!", "age": 19,}
print(dictionary_var, type(dictionary_var))
